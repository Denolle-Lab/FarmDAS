# Monitoring Soil's Seismic Response to Predict Soil Moisture


This package is developed for monitoring the soil seismic response 
using the techniques in the ambient noise field. These techniques 
include estimating the spatial and temporal variations in the seismic 
velocity and attenuation properties of the shallow subsurface materials
-- soil. 

This package is based on the pacakge [Noisepy4DAS][noisepy4das]
to analysis the raw Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) records for 
virtual earthquake data. You can find the [source codes][source] for data processing
and the example [jupyter notebooks][jupyters] that focus on the case study in a 
agricultural setting.
