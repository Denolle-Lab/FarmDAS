This package uses **ambient noise interferometry** to monitor soil hydrodynamic responses under **precipitation, evapotranspiration, and drainage**, allowing the assessment of soil degradation caused by **tillage and compaction**.

## Features
- Analyze soil water fluxes using distributed acoustic sensing (DAS).  
- Process and interpret soil responses to agricultural practices.  
- Reproduce figures from our latest study using provided Jupyter notebooks.

## Dependencies
Data processing is based on the package [NoisePy4DAS][noisepy4das].

## Reproducing Figures
To reproduce figures from [our latest study][paper], see the provided [Jupyter notebooks][jupyters].
