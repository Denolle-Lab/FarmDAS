This package uses ambient noise interferometry to monitor soil's 
hydrodynamic response under precipitation, evapotranspiration, and
drainage, assessing the soil degradation under tillage and compaction.

Data processing is based on the pacakge [Noisepy4DAS][noisepy4das].
To reproduce figures in [our latest study][paper], you can refer to
